# Commit Title (be creative)

## Brief Message/Description of changes

Briefly describe what you've done in a nutshell.
You can ommit this step if your changes are minimal, or it doesn't make sense.

=== File Additions ===

(Add notes to files you've added to the project here)

* File.name
List of
changes made to
this file
(Be creative and descriptive. Don't write "I created this file")

=== File Mods ===

(Add notes to files you've modified.)

* File.name
As above,
list things you've changed.
And why.

Note: If you've added a single file, you may leave the commit message as only the title.
Just make sure that the title is somewhat descriptive!
